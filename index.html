                To Sherlock Holmes she is always <em>the woman</em>. In his eyes, she eclipsed and predominated the whole of her sex. "You see, but you do not observe," he once said, fingers steepled beneath his chin, eyes glinting with deduction. 
                The game is afoot, and facts must be gathered before the mind begins to theorize. "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data," Holmes would lecture, pipe in hand, the air thick with the sweet scent of Persian tobacco. 
                "Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories." His world was a symphony of ash traces, footprints, and half-written telegrams. To the untrained eye, it was chaos. But to Holmes, it was music. “My mind,” he declared once, 
                “rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work.” And so, day after day, mystery after mystery, the rooms at 221B Baker Street became the stage for some of the most bizarre and brilliant deductions known to London. Watson, ever faithful, 
                would shake his head in wonder. "You astound me," he’d mutter. Holmes would only smile. “Naturally,” he’d reply.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                It was the dog that did not bark in the night, the clumsy smear of ink on a suspect’s cuff, the trace of clay on a walking stick that led Holmes to truth.
                 He was no seeker of glory, only of precision. "I am a consulting detective," he’d say, “not a magician.” Scotland Yard, often baffled, would trail behind, 
                 scratching their heads while Holmes vanished down some shadowed alleyway with Watson in tow. “Come, Watson, come! The game is afoot!” And off they'd go, into 
                 the fog-choked streets of Victorian London, chasing clues invisible to everyone else. “The world is full of obvious things,” Holmes said once, “which nobody by any 
                 chance ever observes.” And therein lay his genius. Not in wild guesswork, but in cold, relentless observation. Even in silence, Holmes spoke volumes — through his violin, 
                 through his stillness, through the glint in his eye when the pieces finally clicked. And when the case was solved, he would simply return to his armchair, light his pipe, and speak 
                 no more of it, save to say, “You know my methods. Apply them.”
