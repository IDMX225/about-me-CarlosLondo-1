    <h2>Biography:</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Hi! My name is [Your Name], and I’ve always been the kind of person who likes to figure out how things work. That curiosity is what got me into computers and programming. I think it’s really cool how you can create something from nothing with just code. I want to become a good developer someday—someone who can build helpful and fun things for others to use.</p>

<p>I first got into tech when I built my own PC. It was like a puzzle, and when I finished, it felt amazing. Since then, I’ve been trying to learning how to code. I like making small projects and trying out new things. Even when I get stuck, I enjoy figuring out the problem—it’s all part of the fun.</p>

<p>Besides tech, music is a big part of my life. I’ve been playing the piano for a while, and I recently started learning the bass guitar. Playing music helps me chill out and focus. Sometimes it even helps me think through tricky coding problems. I also enjoy reading, especially mystery books, and learning about new topics just for fun. I’m not sure exactly where all of this will take me, but I’m excited to keep learning and growing.</p>

    <h2>An Excerpt from Sherlock Holmes</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            To Sherlock Holmes she is always <em>the woman</em>. In his eyes, she eclipsed and predominated the whole of her sex. "You see, but you do not observe," he once said, fingers steepled beneath his chin, eyes glinting with deduction. 
            The game is afoot, and facts must be gathered before the mind begins to theorize. "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data," Holmes would lecture, pipe in hand, the air thick with the sweet scent of Persian tobacco. 
            "Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories." His world was a symphony of ash traces, footprints, and half-written telegrams. To the untrained eye, it was chaos. But to Holmes, it was music. “My mind,” he declared once, 
            “rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work.” And so, day after day, mystery after mystery, the rooms at 221B Baker Street became the stage for some of the most bizarre and brilliant deductions known to London. Watson, ever faithful, 
            would shake his head in wonder. "You astound me," he’d mutter. Holmes would only smile. “Naturally,” he’d reply.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            It was the dog that did not bark in the night, the clumsy smear of ink on a suspect’s cuff, the trace of clay on a walking stick that led Holmes to truth.
             He was no seeker of glory, only of precision. "I am a consulting detective," he’d say, “not a magician.” Scotland Yard, often baffled, would trail behind, 
             scratching their heads while Holmes vanished down some shadowed alleyway with Watson in tow. “Come, Watson, come! The game is afoot!” And off they'd go, into 
             the fog-choked streets of Victorian London, chasing clues invisible to everyone else. “The world is full of obvious things,” Holmes said once, “which nobody by any 
             chance ever observes.” And therein lay his genius. Not in wild guesswork, but in cold, relentless observation. Even in silence, Holmes spoke volumes — through his violin, 
             through his stillness, through the glint in his eye when the pieces finally clicked. And when the case was solved, he would simply return to his armchair, light his pipe, and speak 
             no more of it, save to say, “You know my methods. Apply them.”

        CSS clipping and masking are powerful tools in modern web design. They allow designers to create visually stunning effects by manipulating the boundaries of elements and controlling which parts of an element are visible. Whether you're working on complex layouts, interactive animations, or just looking to enhance the design of your website, understanding how to use clipping and masking can open up new possibilities.
        CSS Clipping allows you to hide parts of an element by specifying a region of the element that should remain visible. This is achieved using the clip-path property in CSS. Essentially, the clip-path property lets you define a shape that will "clip" the content of an element, meaning only the portion inside the defined shape is displayed, while the rest is hidden.</p>

        <h3>What is Clipping in CSS? </h3>
    <p> Clipping defines what part of an element is visible. Everything outside the shape you define is hidden. This is done with the clip-path property. According to MDN Web Docs, clip-path can use basic shapes like circle(), ellipse(), or polygon(), or even reference an SVG path.</p>
 <h3>Example: Circle Clip Path</h3>
    <p>html</p>
  
  <pre>
<code>
    div class="circle-clip">
        img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Circle Clipped Image"
      /div   
</code>
</pre>
    <p>css</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
    .circle-clip img {
        width: 300px;
        height: auto;
        clip-path: circle(50% at 50% 50%);
      }
 </code>
        </pre>

<h3>Visual Output:</h3>
<p> This clips the image into a perfect circle centered in the element.  In Kevin Powell’s YouTube tutorial, he explains that clip-path isn’t just for images — it can also apply to text blocks, buttons, and containers, which makes it very versatile.</p>

<h3>Example: Polygon Clip Path (Hexagon)</h3>

<p>css</p>
<code>.hexagon img {
    width: 300px;
    clip-path: polygon(25% 0%, 75% 0%, 100% 50%, 75% 100%, 25% 100%, 0% 50%);
  }</code>
  <p>This example clips the image into a hexagonal shape — perfect for custom avatars or gallery elements.</p>

<h3>What is Masking in CSS?</h3>

<p>Masking, on the other hand, is about transparency. It uses a separate image or gradient to determine which parts of an element are visible. Think of it like laying a stencil over your content.</p>

<p>The W3C’s official spec on CSS Masking explains that you can use mask-image, mask-mode, and mask-composite to control how multiple masks are layered and displayed.</p>
<h3>Example: Masking With an Image</h3>
<p>html</p>
<pre> <code> div class="masked"
    img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Masked Image"
  /div </code> </pre>
<p>css</p>
<code>.masked img {
    width: 300px;
    mask-image: url('your-mask.png');
    -webkit-mask-image: url('your-mask.png'); /* Safari support */
    mask-size: cover;
  }</code>

  <p>The mask image controls which areas of the element remain visible. Opaque areas are fully shown; transparent areas are hidden.</p>

<h3>Example: Masking With a Gradient</h3>
<p>css</p>
<code>.gradient-mask img {
    width: 300px;
    mask-image: linear-gradient(to right, black 50%, transparent 100%);
    -webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(to right, black 50%, transparent 100%);
  }</code>
  <p>This fades the image out from left to right, creating a smooth transition effect.</p>

  <h3>When Should You Use Clipping or Masking?</h3>
  

  <p>Use clipping when:

    You want sharp, clean shape cutouts (like circles or polygons)

    Performance matters — clip-paths are more lightweight

    You don’t need transparency or fading effects
</p>
    <p>
        Use masking when:

        You want gradients or partial visibility
    
        You need to match a custom mask image (like logos or stencils)
    
        You’re designing creative transitions or overlays</p>

       <p> CSS clipping and masking offer web designers powerful ways to shape and reveal content. With clip-path, you can create dynamic and interactive layouts with minimal code. With mask-image, you can push the creative boundaries using transparency, gradients, and layered visuals.

For a deeper dive, I highly recommend Kevin Powell’s video tutorial, which visually explains the differences and offers fun coding examples to follow along with.

By replacing your site’s placeholder content with styled, clipped, and masked visuals, you can create a memorable user experience — and that’s what great design is all about.</p>
