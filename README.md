📄 Project Description

Welcome to my About Me project, created as part of my Web Development 1 course. This project has been a step-by-step journey where I’ve used HTML, CSS, and responsive design techniques to showcase my skills and personal interests through a personalized webpage. Every section of this site has been crafted by hand to reflect who I am — from coding to music to cats!

Over the past few weeks, I’ve learned and applied a variety of front-end development skills including:

    Writing clean and semantic HTML5 structure.

    Using CSS to style pages with layouts, color schemes, and media queries.

    Embedding multimedia like YouTube videos and photo galleries.

    Creating accessible forms using Netlify’s form submission features.

    Implementing navigation bars with internal anchor links and styled logo elements.

I added a personal avatar, a gallery of my PC builds and my cat, and even embedded a classic excerpt from Sherlock Holmes to showcase my love of mystery literature. The contact form was especially interesting to build, and I made sure it works with Netlify.
🎨 Color Scheme

I wanted a warm and creative color scheme that pops visually but still feels readable and inviting.
Element	Color Sample	RGB	Hex
Background	
	rgb(250, 198, 72)	#FAC648
Text and Borders	
	rgb(72, 127, 250)	#487FFA
Section Borders	
	rgb(103, 122, 165)	#677AA5
Header/Section BG	
	rgb(186, 160, 101)	#BAA065

These colors work well across light and dark screens, and I tested them to make sure they meet accessibility standards for contrast.
